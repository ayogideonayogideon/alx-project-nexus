# Project Nexus: Online Poll System (Web, Mobile, or PWA)

## Real-World Application
This project simulates a real-world scenario where developers must create an interactive platform that balances functionality, performance, and user experience. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

- Developing real-time applications with live data updates
- Managing complex state using Redux
- Enhancing user engagement with dynamic visualizations

## Overview
Project Nexus is an interactive online polling platform where users can vote on polls and view live results. The project emphasizes real-time updates, dynamic data visualizations, and seamless user interaction for a practical, real-world application.

## Project Goals
- **API Integration:** Fetch and display poll questions and real-time results from an API.
- **State Management:** Use Redux to efficiently manage application state.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Implement charts to visually represent live poll results.

## Technologies Used
- **React/React Native:** For building the component-based user interface
- **Redux:** To handle state management across the application
- **TypeScript:** To ensure type safety and maintainable code
- **Charting Library:** For creating dynamic visualizations of poll results (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts)

## Key Features
1. **Poll Creation and Voting**
   - Users can create polls with customizable options
   - Users can vote on active polls and share them with others
2. **Real-Time Results Display**
   - Fetch and display live poll results as votes are submitted
   - Charts update dynamically to reflect new data without refreshing
3. **Dynamic Visualizations**
   - Use charts to display poll results in an engaging and easy-to-understand format
   - Responsive visualizations across devices
4. **Form Validation**
   - Validate poll creation forms to ensure all required fields are completed
   - Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid input
